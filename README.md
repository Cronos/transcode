Keyboard Layout Switcher
========================

Transcode can convert text typed in wrong keyboard layout to right text. That's all :)

So, just download (transcode_0.1.dmg)[http://github.com/Flamefork/transcode/tree/master%2Freleases%2Ftranscode_0.1.dmg?raw=true], copy Transcode to Applications and run it.

You will see new menu in each new application's "Services" menu: Transcode, which is mapped on Command-\ hotkey. That's it.

Go use it!
