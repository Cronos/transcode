Transcode - Keyboard Layout Switcher
====================================

Transcode can convert text typed in wrong keyboard layout to right text. That's all :)

So, just download [transcode_0.3.dmg](http://github.com/Flamefork/transcode/tree/master%2Freleases%2Ftranscode_0.3.dmg?raw=true), copy Transcode to Applications and run it.

Now you can change keyboard layout by Command-Space hotkey and layout of selected text will be changed too!

Go use it!
